    <li><u>Afirca Countries Quiz:</u></li>
    The Africa Countries Quiz features 54 countries, though it is important to note that one of these, Western Sahara, is a disputed territory and not universally recognized as a sovereign state. Western Sahara is claimed by both the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and Morocco, with the latter administering most of the region. Due to this territorial dispute, some international bodies and countries do not recognize Western Sahara as a separate country, thus affecting the total count of recognized African nations in various geopolitical contexts.
    <li><u>Asia Countries Quiz:</u></li>
    Similarly, the Asia Countries Quiz lists 50 countries; however, it should be noted that Asia technically features 49 countries due to the unique status of Taiwan. Taiwan operates as a self-governed entity with its own government, economy, and military, yet it is claimed by the People's Republic of China as part of its territory. While Taiwan is recognized as a sovereign state by a limited number of countries and has full participation in some international organizations, the People's Republic of China asserts that it is a province of China, influencing its broader diplomatic recognition. Consequently, Taiwan’s status remains a complex and politically sensitive issue in international relations.
